Text Color: #333333 (Dark Gray)
The primary color and secondary color can be used in various elements throughout the To-Do List App to create a visually appealing and consistent user interface. Here are some suggestions on where to use each color:

Primary Color (#0066CC - Blue):

    Background of the header section.
    Buttons for adding new tasks and editing tasks.
    Checkbox for marking tasks as complete.
    Active state of the filter options (e.g., "All" when selected).
    Accent color for highlighted elements or links.

Secondary Color (#FF4444 - Red):

    Button for deleting tasks.
    Indication for error messages or alerts.
    Hover or active state of certain elements for visual feedback.


    Certainly! Here's a suggested setup of the To-Do List App with different sections to divide the page:

Page Setup:

    Header Section:
        The header section will contain the title of the app, "To-Do List," and any additional app branding or logo.
        This section may also include a button to add a new task, allowing users to easily add new items to their to-do list.

    Main To-Do List Section:
        The main section of the app will display the list of tasks.
        Each task item will show the task name, a checkbox to mark it as complete, an "Edit" button to update the task, and a "Delete" button to remove the task from the list.
        Users can interact with individual tasks, mark them as complete, edit their names, or delete them.

    Completed Tasks Section:
        Below the main to-do list, there will be a separate section to display completed tasks.
        Tasks that are marked as complete will move to this section, providing users with a clear separation of completed and pending tasks.

    Filter Options:
        At the top right corner, include filter options ("All," "Active," "Completed") to show different subsets of tasks based on their completion status.
        Users can use these options to filter and view specific sets of tasks, such as only completed tasks or active tasks.

    Footer Section:
        The footer section can contain additional information about the app, copyright details, and links to relevant pages or external resources.

Page Layout:

The suggested layout might look like this:
